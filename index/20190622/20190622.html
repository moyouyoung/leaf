<p>Moyou is having a nice day today! <br/> 
The dried flower was selected from the silica gel desiccant early this morning and carefully transferred into the little glass bottle. With the little card cut from a postcard picturing the No Face Man, moyou thought this would be a good match. <br/>
Though it was a long wait for FQL to finish her haircut, the new look is really great and totally worth the hours. Well, actually in the mean time, moyou spent a lot of time walking in the Gulou Campus and made a selfie with the famous 1919 symbol. He even met his high school biology teacher JSL who was the head teacher of the class as well. <br/>
This is the first day of this iLog. Moyou really hopes everyone behind that shimmering screen could enjoy it.
