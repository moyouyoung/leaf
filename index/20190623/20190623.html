<h1>One Big Thing!</h1>
<p>
Moyou bought his ticket to New York today! The trip takes overall 25 hours with 8 hours staying at Beijing. Now, the only obstacle between moyou and America is vaccination. 
</p>
<h2>Some little things</h2>
<p>
The plant didn't work well today. Some of the leaves turned yellow and most of the leaves lowered their stems. Moyou has watered it. Now he turns the light a little bit warmer to see if anything goes better. Do you have any suggestions? 
</p>
<p>PS: The "Comment" part of this website is still under construction. Drop by sometime and moyou will make it happen!</p>
